# Welcome to `control_freak`!

`control_freak` is a part of the [Risk Redux](https://risk-redux.io) project, which seeks to turn NIST frameworks into practical web applications.

The `rev-5` branch represents [the final form of NIST SP 800-53, Rev 5](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final).

The schema for `rev-5` is significantly different from previous versions and merging them all would be messy. Instead, we've captured a release of `rev-4` but will only be maintaing `rev-5` as a live site at [https://controlfreak.risk-redux.io](https://controlfreak.risk-redux.io).
